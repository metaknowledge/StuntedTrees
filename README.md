# Stunted Trees

A PaperMC plugin to make tree growth more realistic by changing how trees grow in different biomes.

## Demo
Left tree is in jungle biome right tree is in dark oak wood forest

## Requirements
The world must have the stunted_trees_datapack in the datapack folders
reload the world after added the datapack

### Config
Uses a config file to specify what biomes work for each tree. Can be found in src/resources/config.yml
Uses datapacks to generate trees with the tree definition provided by mojang. Edit the file in the datapack to get different tree generation.

## Current Limitations
I have only made configurations for the large spruce, jungle, and mangrove trees.
